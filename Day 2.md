##  How Burp Suite Works

1. **Intercepting Traffic**: 
   - Burp acts as a proxy between the browser and the web application.
   - Users can capture, modify, and forward requests.

2. **Scanning for Vulnerabilities**: 
   - The scanner identifies issues like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
   - Both passive and active scanning modes are available.

3. **Automated Attacks with Intruder**: 
   - Intruder is used for brute-force attacks and fuzzing input fields.

4. **Manual Testing with Repeater**: 
   - Allows testers to modify requests and analyze responses in real-time.

5. **Extensibility**: 
   - Users can enhance Burp's functionality using BApp Store or custom scripts.
